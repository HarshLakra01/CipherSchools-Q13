# Responsive Card Demo

This project demonstrates a responsive card component using HTML and CSS. The card automatically scales its width and padding for smaller screens, making it mobile-friendly.

## Features

- **Image and content** inside the card
- **Smooth scaling** for mobile devices using CSS media queries
- Clean and modern design

## Files

- `index.html` — The main HTML file with the card structure.
- `style.css` — Contains all CSS styles, including responsive rules.
- `README.md` — This documentation file.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Resize the browser window or open the page on a mobile device to see the card scale responsively.

## Customization

- Replace the sample image URL in the `.card-img` tag with your own image.
- Adjust card content as needed.
- Modify breakpoints and padding in `style.css` for different responsive behavior.
